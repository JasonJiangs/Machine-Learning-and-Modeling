The purpose of this study is mainly to compare the development of six Chinese regions in the area of agriculture in the last seven years. According to Chinese official classification, they divide China into six regions: northern region, northeastern region, eastern region, central southern region, southwestern region, and northwestern region. Thirty recorded provinces will be categorized into six classes, and then taking indexes of farming, forestry, animal husbandry, and fishery as four features to perform machine learning models. The study performs algorithms like support vector machine, decision tree, k-means clustering, n-nearest neighbor, multiple linear regression, and principal component analysis to do the training and prediction; meanwhile, compare between and inside the models through indicators and visualizations. Besides, multi-angle visualization will be shown to explore more reasonable results. The goal is to find out the difference in agriculture between the six Chinese regions and explore the feasibility of machine learning models on this particular dataset.

Based on the data set of growth rates of personal consumption and personal income in the USA, performing multiple models used different theories like time-series, neural network, and machine learning to predict and calculate the unemployment rate as well as the indicators of each model. The purpose of this study is mainly to check the effectiveness of the models predicting data from the area of economics. Besides, for the machine learning part, the experiment compares the efficacy of original data and reduced data after principal component analysis. The goal is to explore the practicability of multiple models using different skills on this particular dataset.
